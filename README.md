Documentation

This web app is still being developed. Documentation will be made available later.


Usage
--------

This application is intended to run on Azure or locally. If run locally then it requires the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to be downloaded and installed (preferably on the server where it is to run).

Having installed the SDK: download the application from GitHub (either using git or by downloading and unzipping the zip file), and then build and publish it.
